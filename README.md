# Provo-TSA-Video-Game-Project

The provo high project for the 2025-26 TSA video game competition

This project, made with unity and C#, is a top-down zelda-style rpg with retro elements.

It takes on an 8-bit like art style, where the hero fights against furniture as your main enemy.

The main goal of the project is to replicate the magic once felt by retro game fans of the past, but putting a modern twist on a more traditional genre.

Coding conventions:
- camelCase
- Present-tense commit messages (ex. update readme, NOT updated readme)
- Per-contributor branches (for now)

# Additional information

Because of the way that we started the project, our gitignore didn't work, meaning we had to restart the .git of the project on 02/03/2026. You will not see git history before this date, though progress was made
