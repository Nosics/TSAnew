# Provo-TSA-Video-Game-Project

The provo high project for the 2025-26 TSA video game competition

This project, made with unity and C#, is a top-down zelda-style rpg with retro elements.

The main goal of the project is to replicate the magic once felt by retro game fans of the past, but putting a modern twist on a more traditional genre.

Coding conventions:
- camelCase
