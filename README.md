# Provo-TSA-Video-Game-Project

The provo high project for the 2025-26 TSA video game competition

This project, made with unity and C#, is a top-down zelda-style rpg with retro elements.

The main goal of the project is to replicate the magic once felt by retro game fans of the past, but putting a modern twist on a more traditional genre.

Coding conventions:
- camelCase
- Present-tense commit messages
- Per-contributor branches (for now)

# Additional information

Because of the way that we started the project, our gitignore didn't work, meaning we had to restart the .git of the project on 02/03/2026. You will not see git history before this date, though progress was made
